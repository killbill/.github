## Welcome to Kill Bill!

The Kill Bill billing system and payments platform is feature-rich out-of-the-box and highly customizable. Use it for highly complex billing schemes, including one-offs, recurring, and usage-based plans. 

Kill Bill is not an all-in-one solution. Instead, it's highly modularized; you can disable the functionality you don't need or replace functionality with one of your existing systems. The real power of Kill Bill lies in building your own business logic on top of it to create a customized billing and payments solution. 

You can write plugins to modify Kill Bill's behavior and integrate with third-party vendors. Kill Bill already has many open-source plugins. Use them as examples for creating your own or modify them for your own use.

Your business doesn't need to rely on the uptime or processing speed of a SaaS provider. You choose where to run Kill Bill from, on-premise or in the cloud, like [Kill Bill on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=2db108d7-56d5-4f62-884e-6f92e4d5eea8).
